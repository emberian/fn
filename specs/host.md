# Host and execution boundary

Status: Common Lisp host proposed; implementation/version and integration path
are D07. No host adapter is present.

## Core interface

Conceptual events include connection-opened, input-octets, connection-closed,
clock/contact observation, storage-completed, storage-indeterminate, and operator
request. Effects include output-octets, close-connection, persist-transaction,
schedule-work, and report-fault. M1 supplies exact constructors and guards.

HST-001: the host executes the same core definitions used for the proof claims,
or a separately justified refinement. It does not reimplement acceptance,
authorization, numbering, or GC in a different language. Guard verification and
boundary argument validation establish conditions for safe raw execution.

HST-002: events/results carry connection and transaction generations sufficient
to reject stale completions after restart, disconnect, or identifier reuse.
Scheduling serializes shared semantic transitions. Output may be partially written;
the host tracks offsets and never reruns a state transition to finish a write.
Quotas bound per-session staging and pending effects so one peer cannot monopolize
the state owner merely by refusing to consume output.

HST-003: platform persistence primitives have a documented contract tied to
A-DURABILITY and A-WRITE-ISOLATION. The host reports known failure and uncertain
completion distinctly. Recovery owns reconciliation after uncertainty; socket
disconnect does not establish storage rollback. Adapter/platform validation is
required in addition to ACL2 proofs.

HST-004: I/O, clocks, cryptographic primitives, and authentication are explicit
trust-boundary entries. The production integration must not contaminate book
certification with arbitrary raw-mode changes or hide trusted code inside a
claimed proved function. Certify the pure core in a clean environment.

## Scope of the first adapter

Prefer one host process, one owner of core state, bounded I/O staging, and local
configuration. A test host first interprets effects against simulated disk and
network models. The real host follows after its event contract and error behavior
are executable. Web/9p/BP adapters use these same contracts later.

Exact packaging is open: use certified ACL2 definitions in a supported host image
with controlled integration, and document any raw Lisp boundary. A hand-maintained
shadow implementation is not the intended path to a smaller binary.
